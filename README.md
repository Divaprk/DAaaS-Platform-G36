# Project Overview: Data Analytics as a Service (DAaaS)

## 1. Goal
The objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a cloud-native Data Analytics as a Service (DAaaS) platform deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. The focus is on demonstrating cloud architecture, scalability, security, and operational principles.

## 2. Platform Capabilities
The platform will enable users to:
* **Access** a curated dataset sourced from data.gov.sg (MOH, LTA, or MOE).
* **Invoke** at least three (3) statistical analytics functions.
* **Visualize** results through a web-based user interface.

## 3. Technical Requirements
* **Cloud Architecture:** Must utilize core AWS services including Compute (EC2/Lambda), Storage (S3), Database (RDS/DynamoDB), and Networking (VPC/Subnets).
* **Analytics:** Must be based on classical statistical methods (e.g., descriptive statistics, time-series, or comparative analysis) and **must not** use AI or Machine Learning.
* **Security:** Must implement clear separation of concerns, secure configuration, and access control.

## 4. Project Phases
* **Phase 1: Cloud Solution Design** – Problem definition, service model selection (IaaS/PaaS), and detailed architecture diagramming.
* **Phase 2: Cloud Implementation** – AWS environment setup, data ingestion, and web application development.
* **Phase 3: Evaluation and Analysis** – Performance stress testing (e.g., via Apache JMeter), cost analysis, and scalability assessment.

## 5. Deliverables
* **Written Report:** A 10–20 page PDF document covering all three phases and including an AI Usage Declaration.
* **Video Presentation:** An 8-minute YouTube video demonstrating the platform and individual contributions.
